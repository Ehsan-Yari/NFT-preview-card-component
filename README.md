## My process

### Built with

- ViteJS
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I had the opportunity to experiment with ViteJS and TailwindCSS. The biggest takeaway was understanding how ViteJS speeds up the development process with its hot module replacement and efficient bundling. TailwindCSS allowed me to quickly style the card with utility classes, making it easy to customize the design.

```html
<div class="max-w-xs mx-auto bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg overflow-hidden">
  <img class="w-full h-64 object-cover" src="image.jpg" alt="NFT image">
</div>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving accessibility features like adding `aria` roles and optimizing for screen readers. I also want to get better at using advanced features of TailwindCSS, such as customizing themes and working with variants.

### Useful resources

- [ViteJS Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) - I found this resource very helpful in getting started with ViteJS.
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - TailwindCSS was a great tool for this project, and their documentation is super easy to follow.
